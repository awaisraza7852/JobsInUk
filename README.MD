# Jobs in United Kingdom and London

Data was downloaded from Uk [Gov website](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/workforce-jobs/73bcf44b-162f-4941-88ab-4418a19807d1/workforce-jobs-ons.csv). 

Data was already clean and I just wanted to see trend of data. You may go through notebook. It's sad to see that number of self empoyment jobs did not have any major changes since 2005 till now.
